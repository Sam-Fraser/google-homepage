From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Explanation/Goal:
This is the first project in the Odin Project's curriculum under their web development 101 course. The goal of this project is to create a webpage that looks like the google homepage. It does not have the funtionality of the google homepage, but it does look like it. This is to practice the skills that I learned in moving objects around a webpage using css and structuring a webpage with html.
