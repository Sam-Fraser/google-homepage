From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Explanation/Goal:
This is the first project in the Odin Project's curriculum under their web development 101 course. The goal of this project is to create a webpage that looks like the google homepage. It does not have the funtionality of the google homepage, but it does look like it. This is to practice the skills that I learned in moving objects around a webpage using css and structuring a webpage with html.

Reflection:
This assignment was a lot more difficult than I though it would be.  But hey, I finished my first website from the ground up.  I used flex boxes to place the lists in the nav bar and footer.  I also tried using a flex box to center the main section of the website.  This did not work as intended.  Although I was able to center the main section, everything was left justified in the center.  In the end I could not figure out how to center justify everything so I simply used the <center> tag in the html document itself.

After I had everything placed where I wanted it I added hover and focus funtionality to my links, buttons, and search bar.  Styling was fun and simple, placing everything was difficult.  I also opted to use the words apps and user instead of the icons since I could not figure out how to place them.
